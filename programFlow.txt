Import dataSet from site (JSON)
serialize data set (avro) 
Send dataSet to data store (This could be a simple file store or possibly a noSQL 
	DB)
serialize data set (ProtoBuf)

Send data set to separate data-store

if I use a simple file data-store could implement fairly easily
Utilizing a noSQL DB might be more representative of a real world scenario.


implement OTel for tracking

What needs to measured?
- Process time for transmitting data.
	- in-bound and out-bound for all three formats
- Process time and compute cost for serializing and deserializing data
- Transmit costs of serialized and unserialized 

What testing should be performed?
- test cases:
	- Small data set with small number of fields (< 10)
	- Small data set with large number of fields (>=10)
	- Large data set with small number of fields
	- Large data set with large number of fields
	* possibly set up in both Java and C++
	* utilizing data store
