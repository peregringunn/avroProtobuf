Meeting notes 31 Aug 2022:

Figure out how to take in any size message.

Schema automation.

possibly use a stream handeler like kafka.

possibly write a method to auto generate a schema from json object.

possibly write a method to auto generate a new class on the fly.

Maybe create a fresh application to handle generic messages.

Sai: "not useful if has to manually configured"
